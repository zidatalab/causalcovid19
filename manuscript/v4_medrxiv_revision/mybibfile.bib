	abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which offer systematic representations of causal relationships, have become an established framework for the analysis of causal inference in epidemiology, often being used to determine covariate adjustment sets for minimizing confounding bias. DAGitty is a popular web application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the R package ‘dagitty’, which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package ‘dagitty’ can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate ‘statistically equivalent’ but causally different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R package ‘dagitty’ is available through the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source code is available on github at [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty]. The web application ‘DAGitty’ is free software, licensed under the GNU general public licence (GPL) version 2 and is available at [http://dagitty.net/].},

To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic.Science, this issue p. 395Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80\% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90\% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50\% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impact of mobility on epidemic spreading is of crucial importance for understanding the effect of policies like mass quarantines and selective re-openings. High mobility between areas contribute to the importation of cases, affecting the spread of the disease. While many factors influence local incidence and making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can give rise to autonomous outbreaks that impact separate areas of the contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost local incidence and size, making control and tracing measures less effective. In Spain, the high heterogeneity in incidence between similar areas despite the uniform mobility control measures taken suggests that multi-seeding could have played an important role in shaping the spreading of the disease. In this work, we focus on the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 among the \$52\$ Spanish provinces, showing that local incidence strongly correlates with mobility occurred in the early-stage weeks from and to Madrid, the main mobility hub and where the initial local outbreak unfolded. These results clarify the higher order effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight the relevance of its control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementM.M. is funded by the Conselleria d'Innovacio, Recerca i Turisme of the Government of the Balearic Islands and the European Social Fund with grant code FPI/2090/2018.

	abstract = {Background: As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts. Methods: Here, in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data with the goals of identifying the high risk areas of disease spread and assessing the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. We compared the impact of intracity vs. intercity travel restrictions on both the total number of infections and the speed of outbreak spread and developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions. Findings: We found that intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on overall infection numbers than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. We also identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. Interpretation: In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. Both intracity and intercity movement affect outbreak dynamics, with the former having more of an impact on the total numbers of cases and the latter impacting geographic scope. These findings have important implications for guiding future policies for travel restrictions during outbreaks in Taiwan.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (MOST 109-2636-B-007-006).

Numerous factors could influence the transmission  rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest  epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS)  can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The  analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the  performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends  to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel  coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of  each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy  and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity  analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that  AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no  scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is  less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the  cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter  inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health  problem globally. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that  ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses.  This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the  infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: Daily confirmed cases and  meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to  February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the  nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We  also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail.  RESULTS: The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean  temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of  {\textless}3 °C and became flat above 3 °C. When mean temperature (lag0-14) was below 3 °C,  each 1 °C rise was associated with a 4.861\% (95\% CI: 3.209-6.513) increase in the  daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our  sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mean temperature has a  positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of  3 °C. There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline  when the weather becomes warmer, which provides useful implications for policymakers  and the public.},

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that weather  conditions may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases.  However, some contradictory studies have also been reported in the same research  line. In addition, many of these studies have been performed considering only  meteorological factors, which can limit the reliability of the results. Herein, we  report a spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature  (mean, minimum and maximum) on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the  provinces of Spain. Non-meteorological factors such as population density,  population by age, number of travellers and number of companies have also been  considered for the analysis.

We used daily average temperature (hourly data),  daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, and RMB (Chinese currency) exchange  rate to represent the weather, COVID-19 outbreak and the Chinese economy,  respectively. The methodology of Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Partial Wavelet  Coherence (PWC) and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) is employed to analyze the  daily data collected from 21st January 2020 to 31st March 2020. The results have  revealed a significant coherence between the series at different time-frequency  combinations. The overall results suggest the insignificance of an increase in  temperature to contain or slow down the new COVID-19 infections. The RMB exchange  rate and the COVID-19 showed an out phase coherence at specific time-frequency spots  suggesting a negative but limited impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan on the  Chinese export economy. Our results are contrary to many earlier studies which  suggest a significant role of temperature in slowing down the COVID-19 spread.

	abstract = {Background: Faced with the global pandemic of COVID-19, declared by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020, and the need to better understand the seasonal behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its correlation with different weather factors such as temperature and relative humidity. Methods: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence generated was graded as low. However, these variables alone could not explain most of the variability in disease transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoneAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its airborne spread via droplets. The impact of environmental factors on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is under consideration. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the impact of environmental factors on human coronaviruses. Temperature, humidity and other environmental factors have been recorded as environmental drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and in other countries. Higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. In our review, the analysis of 23 studies show evidence that high temperature and high humidity reduce the COVID-19 transmission. However, further studies concerning other environmental (namely meteorological) factors role should be conducted in order to further prove this correlation. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementno fundingAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in more than  250 countries has become a serious threat to the health of people around the world.  Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the  disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. Therefore, in this study, was  discussed the role of environmental factors and conditions such as temperature,  humidity, wind speed as well as food, water and sewage, air, insects,  inanimate surfaces, and hands in COVID-19 transmission. The results of studies on  the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of  this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others. Temperature increase and  sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on  surfaces. When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 °C, the cumulative  number of cases decreases by 0.86\%. According to the latest evidence, the presence  of coronavirus in the sewer has been confirmed, but there is no evidence that it is  transmitted through sewage or contaminated drinking water. Also, SARS-COV-2  transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified  as a risk factor for the disease. According to the latest studies, the possibility  of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the  internal environment of ophthalmology. The results additionally show that infectious  bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet. There have been no reports of SARS-COV-2  transmission by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes.},

abstract = "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge facing the world. Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19."

The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological  factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have  robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases.  However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work  aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the  state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed  cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital  cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was  applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average  temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression  model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the  capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear  relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19  in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated  with a -4.8951\% (t = -2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative  confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the  results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression  model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of  Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C.  Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the  number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C. There is  no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C. The  study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to  predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from the  Google Trends website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models  were used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models were  evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was used  as the performance metric. RESULTS: The linear regression model predicted the  incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 (SD 6.492). The most effective factors besides  previous day incidence included the search frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer,  and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was 27.187 (SD 20.705).  CONCLUSIONS: Data mining algorithms can be employed to predict trends of outbreaks.  This prediction might support policymakers and health care managers to plan and  allocate health care resources accordingly.},

Internet search interest was found  to be correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but has not yet been  applied to the USA. Therefore, we examined the association of internet  search-interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the USA. METHODS: We  extracted COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA from two population-based  datasets, namely 1-point-3-acres.com and the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data repository.  The internet search-interest of COVID-19-related terms was obtained using Google  Trends. The Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine  correlations and predict trends, respectively. RESULTS: There were 636,282 new cases  and,325 deaths of COVID-19 in the USA from March 1 to April 15, 2020, with a crude  mortality of 4.45\%. The daily new cases peaked at 35,098 cases on April 10, 2020 and  the daily deaths peaked at 2,494 on April 15, 2020. The search interest of COVID,  "COVID pneumonia" and "COVID heart" were correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence,  with 12 or 14 days of delay (Pearson's r = 0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and  deaths with 19 days of delay (Pearson's r = 0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively).  The 7-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed no significant  correlations of the observed data with the predicted daily new cases or daily  deaths, using search interest of COVID, COVID heart, and COVID pneumonia.

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and  successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In  light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan,  China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread  of the new coronavirus disease in Europe. METHODS: Time series from Google Trends  from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of "Coronavirus" were retrieved and  correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the  European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional  level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Statistically  significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and  deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation  coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was  identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries  that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology  metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be  useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for  example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and  Zika.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed stress on  the health and well-being of both Chinese people and the public worldwide. Global  public interest in this new issue largely reflects people's attention to COVID-19  and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine  global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. METHODS: Using Google  Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of "2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel  coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019" between the  31(st) December 2019 and the 24(th) February 2020 in six major English-speaking  countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.  Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search  volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries  and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The  correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the  daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. RESULTS: The overall  search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of  observing time and reached the first apex on 31(st) January 2020. A shorter response  time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public  from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A  slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number  of confirmed cases was observed (P {\textless} 0.05). People across countries presented a  various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was  different in various sub-regions within countries. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest  that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the  overall duration of public attention was short. The current study reminds us that  governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the  public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of  protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the  spread of COVID-19 globally.},

The  course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and  disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information.  Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public  announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show  that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the  elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements  are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for  "coronavirus" increased by about 36\% (95\% CI: 27 to 44\%) on the day immediately  after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less  than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in  their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by  searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other  hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine,  school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery  delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by  first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively  early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the  public discourse. Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to  subsequent flows of public information.},

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective  vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control  measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an  emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our  collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the  infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the  interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the  effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic  reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model  with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and  the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the  early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media  reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public  awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the  peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides  improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way  to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
Reviews zu Studien der Primärforschung werden zunehmend wichtiger, da das Konzept der evidenzbasierten Praxis in der Gesundheitsversorgung immer mehr an Einfluss gewinnt und die Zahl der Forschungsvorhaben enorm gestiegen ist. Zu den eher weniger bekannten Review-Typen gehört der „Scoping Review“. Scoping Reviews werden eingesetzt, wenn zunächst eine Orientierung über den Stand der Forschungsliteratur erlangt werden soll. Sie werden beispielsweise erstellt, um vorläufige Arbeitsdefinitionen festzulegen oder Themen bzw. Themenfelder konzeptionell abzugrenzen. Die Erstellung eines Scoping Reviews ist auch dann sinnvoll, wenn die Literatur noch nicht umfassend bewertet wurde oder wenn sie eine komplexe bzw. heterogene Problematik aufweist, so dass ein präziserer systematischer Review der Evidenz nicht angezeigt ist. Scoping Reviews können auch dazu dienen, die Bedeutung und den Umfang eines angedachten klassischen systematischen Reviews zu bestimmen. Scoping Reviews sind schließlich eine gute Methode, um Forschungsergebnisse zu bündeln bzw. zu kommunizieren, Forschungslücken auszuweisen und Empfehlungen für die zukünftige Forschungsarbeit zu unterbreiten. Dieser Artikel vermittelt den Leser*innen die Methodik der Scoping Reviews, konkretisiert die Unterschiede zu systematischen Reviews und erklärt, warum sie durchgeführt werden könnten. Diese Anleitung für die Durchführung von Scoping Reviews basiert auf der vom Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) entwickelten Methodik.
Reviews of primary research studies are becoming increasingly important as the concept of evidence-based practice in healthcare is gaining more and more influence and the number of research projects is increasing enormously. One of the less well-known types of review is the “scoping review.” Scoping reviews are conducted when one first needs to take stock of the research literature. For example, scoping reviews are conducted in order to establish provisional working definitions or to define topics or subject areas conceptually. Preparing a scoping review also makes sense if the literature has not yet been comprehensively assessed or if it contains a complex or heterogeneous problem so that a more precise systematic review of the evidence is not appropriate. Scoping reviews can also serve to determine the scope and significance of a prospective classical systematic review. Finally, scoping reviews are also a good way to bundle and communicate research results, identify research gaps, and formulate recommendations for future research. This article explains the methodology of scoping reviews, their differences as compared to systematic reviews, and the reasons why they could be conducted. This guide to conducting scoping reviews is based on the methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).},

	abstract = {Background: Previous research on infectious disease has revealed that infection risk as well as the severity of diseases is related to income and poverty. In this study we investigate if unemployed persons have a higher risk to become hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis compared with employed persons. Methods: We used routine data on hospitalizations in a study population of 1,298,416persons between the ages 18 and 65 who were enrolled in a German health insurance and who were active on the labour market (either employed or unemployed). Hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10-GM U07.1 and U07.2) were reported on a daily basis from 01.01.2020 to 04.06.2020. We studied if the rate of persons hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnoses differed by employment situation. Logistic regression models comparing employed with short- and long-term unemployed were calculated adjusting for age and sex. Results: In total, we observed 1,311 persons who were hospitalized, corresponding to a rate of 100.98 cases per 100.000 in our study population. Rates varied between the groups in different employment situations with lowest rates for employed and highest for long-term unemployed. Odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.84 (1.64 - 2.07) for long-term and 1.18 (0.75 - 1.85) for short-term unemployed compared with employed persons. Conclusion: The results are in line with earlier (mainly ecological) studies from the USA and Great Britain which found social inequalities in hospitalization risk. The fact that differences exist in Germany, a country with a universal health care system, indicates socioeconomic differences in the COVID-19 pandemic exists across countries.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementno external funding was receivedAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Data are part of the routine data collection of hospitals and insurance carriers.

Our identification approach exploits regional variation in the point in time when face masks became compulsory. Depending on the region we analyse, we find that face masks reduced the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases between 2.3% and 13% over a period of 10 days after they became compulsory. Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40%.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the association between physical distancing interventions and incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) globally.Design Natural experiment using interrupted time series analysis, with results synthesised using meta-analysis.Setting 149 countries or regions, with data on daily reported cases of covid-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and data on the physical distancing policies from the Oxford covid-19 Government Response Tracker.Participants Individual countries or regions that implemented one of the five physical distancing interventions (closures of schools, workplaces, and public transport, restrictions on mass gatherings and public events, and restrictions on movement (lockdowns)) between 1 January and 30 May 2020.Main outcome measure Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of covid-19 before and after implementation of physical distancing interventions, estimated using data to 30 May 2020 or 30 days post-intervention, whichever occurred first. IRRs were synthesised across countries using random effects meta-analysis.Results On average, implementation of any physical distancing intervention was associated with an overall reduction in covid-19 incidence of 13\% (IRR 0.87, 95\% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89; n=149 countries). Closure of public transport was not associated with any additional reduction in covid-19 incidence when the other four physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR with and without public transport closure was 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88; n=72, and 0.87, 0.84 to 0.91; n=32, respectively). Data from 11 countries also suggested similar overall effectiveness (pooled IRR 0.85, 0.81 to 0.89) when school closures, workplace closures, and restrictions on mass gatherings were in place. In terms of sequence of interventions, earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in covid-19 incidence (pooled IRR 0.86, 0.84 to 0.89; n=105) compared with a delayed implementation of lockdown after other physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR 0.90, 0.87 to 0.94; n=41).Conclusions Physical distancing interventions were associated with reductions in the incidence of covid-19 globally. No evidence was found of an additional effect of public transport closure when the other four physical distancing measures were in place. Earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in the incidence of covid-19. These findings might support policy decisions as countries prepare to impose or lift physical distancing measures in current or future epidemic waves.},
