I find the topic of the paper very important and the methodology very interesting. The author has used a number of variables to analyse possible determinants of COVID-19 infections. While the paper acknowledges that there are social factors which affect the spread of the COVID-19 this is not properly discussed in the paper. I strongly suggest the author to refer to the literature on Social Determinants of Health when discussing social variables. For example see the recent paper by Galanis and Hanieh in Social Science and Medicine on Incorporating Social Determinants of Health into Modelling of COVID-19 and references therein.
